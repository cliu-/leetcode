128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Hard

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

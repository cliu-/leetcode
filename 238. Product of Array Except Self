238. Product of Array Except Self
Medium

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
```

    return arr

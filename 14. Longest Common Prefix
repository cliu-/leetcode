14. Longest Common Prefix
Easy

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
```
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

Note:

All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """

```

my answer below, this answer running with python2 would exhaust the computation resource, because in python2, the statement `range(2**32)` will create a array with size 2**32. But it works with python3, because in python3, the `range()` behavior is the same as `xrange()` of python2.  
```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs: return ''
    ans=''
    for i in range(2**32):
        t=''
        for s in strs:
            if i==len(s):
                return ans
            if not t: t=s[i]
            elif t!=s[i]: return ans
            else: continue
        ans+=t
    return ans
```

Below answer are both accepted in python2 and python3.
```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs: return ''
    ans=''
    for i in xrange(2**32):
        t=''
        for s in strs:
            if i==len(s):
                return ans
            if not t: t=s[i]
            elif t!=s[i]: return ans
            else: continue
        ans+=t
    return ans
```

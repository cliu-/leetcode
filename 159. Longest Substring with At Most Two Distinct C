159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
Medium

Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """

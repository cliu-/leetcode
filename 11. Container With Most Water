11. Container With Most Water
Medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

```

Two pointers approach:
```python
def maxArea(height):
    if not height or len(height)==1: return 0
    ans,l,r=0,0,len(height)-1
    while l<r:
        h=min(height[l],height[r])
        if h*(r-l)>ans:
            ans=h*(r-l)
        if height[l]>=height[r]: r-=1
        else: l+=1
    return ans
```

254. Factor Combinations
Medium

Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,

8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

Note:

You may assume that n is always positive.
Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: []

Example 2:

Input: 37
Output:[]

Example 3:

Input: 12
Output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]

Example 4:

Input: 32
Output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]

58. Length of Last Word
Easy

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters `' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:
```
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """

```

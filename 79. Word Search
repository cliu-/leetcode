79. Word Search
Medium

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:
```
board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def exist(self, board, word):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
```

This problem needs to review, I spent 2hours on it and used debug tool to fix some issues.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def exist(board, word):
    if not board or not word: return False
    m,n=len(board),len(board[0])
    def func(i,word,x,y,visited=set()):
        if (x,y) in visited: return False
        if i == len(word): return True
        visited.add((x,y))
        if x>0 and board[x-1][y]==word[i]:
            if func(i+1,word,x-1,y,visited): return True
        if x<m-1 and board[x+1][y]==word[i]:
            if func(i+1,word,x+1,y,visited): return True
        if y>0 and board[x][y-1]==word[i]:
            if func(i+1,word,x,y-1,visited): return True
        if y<n-1 and board[x][y+1]==word[i]:
            if func(i+1,word,x,y+1,visited): return True
        visited.remove((x, y))
        return False
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if board[i][j]==word[0]:
                if func(1,word,i,j):
                    return True
    return False
```

assert(exist([["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]],"ABCCED")==True)
